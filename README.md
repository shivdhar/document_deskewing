# Document Deskewing

## Our Approach

- The basic idea is to obtain the orientation of text characters/words/sentences/blocks/paragraghs

- Compare with the previous approaches of getting the orientation of the "image" as opposed to the text within it.

- To do this, we need the bounding boxes of the text characters.
